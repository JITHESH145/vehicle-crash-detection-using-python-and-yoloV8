# Vehicle Crash Detection using YOLOv8 and Python

This repository contains a project that detects vehicle crashes from a video using the YOLOv8 model and Python. The project is designed to analyze video footage and identify instances where vehicles collide, making it a useful tool for traffic monitoring, accident detection, and safety analysis.

## Introduction

This project leverages the YOLOv8 model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect vehicle crashes in real-time from video input. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is known for its speed and accuracy, making it ideal for applications that require quick detection and response.

## Features

- **Real-time crash detection**: The model processes video frames and identifies vehicle collisions as they happen.
- **High accuracy**: Utilizes YOLOv8, which is optimized for detecting objects with precision.
- **Easy integration**: Simple to integrate into existing systems or use as a standalone tool for traffic analysis.
- **Customizable**: The model and code can be fine-tuned for specific use cases or different types of crashes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-crash-detection.git
   cd vehicle-crash-detection
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that you have the YOLOv8 model installed. You can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov8) to set it up.

## Usage

1. Place your input video in the `videos/` directory.
2. Run the crash detection script:

   ```bash
   python detect_crash.py --video videos/your_video.mp4
   ```

   Replace `your_video.mp4` with the name of your video file.

3. The script will process the video and output the results, including crash events, which will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Results

The results of the crash detection will include annotated videos where crashes are detected, along with any relevant data saved to the `output/` directory.
